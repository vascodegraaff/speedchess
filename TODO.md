## TODO
### backend
- move generation
- move validation
- captures dont work, check out the wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)#:~:text=When%20a%20piece%20makes%20a,captures%20the%20piece%20on%20d5).

eg when 2 horses can eat a piece, you need to be able to distinguish between the two peices
- edge cases (check, castling, prawn promotion)

- captures dont work
- set game state
- distingish between player 1 and player 2 and rerender board on each move
- timer
- set timer on move
- redefine game constructor
- game analytics can just store as a json file that gets updated after each game
